# ZupaApp

Hello welcome

This is Zupa App. Zupa App is an application that serves as the protection of women and children against violence. This application has features such as: 
1. SOS Button: The SOS Button functions as a voice recorder where the victim or potential victim receives violence or before receiving violence. The recorded voice will be sent along with the victim's location at that time and the victim's information to the officers. The victim's voice will also be processed through Machine Learning which will classify the violence experienced by the victim. So, the victim does not need to take long to make a phone call or fill out a reporting form. 
2. Form: This feature is a form feature intended to report crimes against women and children.
